This is a tool with the purpose of duplicating objects and setting the offsets of it without manually setting the positions or rotations yourself.  
  
There are three ways you can use this:
- using your `MOUSE` (Left Click, Right Click, Scroll Wheel) to position and add different adjacent models
- using the `W, A, S, D` keys to quickly add adjacent objects (only `4 axis`)
- rotate objects in local space using `RIGHT SHIFT` + `W, A, S, D`

There are a couple of objects in which their offsets and models have been specified so you can join tracks very quickly, any object that is not part of that list won't be able to use different models, you will only be able to clone itself on `6 axis` by default (works with any object in the game).

This is a massive improvement from the `Mirage's Magic Tool`, this doesn't use any of it's code, but rather was an inspiration to make this one.  

For guide in using the tool, download it, start it in your editor and do `/mtphelp` to see a list of commands.  
To change settings, please take a look at the `config.lua` file.
